# Done

Client class is similar to Person class, so started with refactoring to reduce work later.
* Moved SQL queries into a separate file. Easier to review all SQL functionality.
* Converted from Thymeleaf to Angular.
  * Delete Person doesn't need to be a separate page. A dialog box will suffice.
  * Edit and New can be combined into 1 component to reduce duplication.

# TODO

* Convert API endpoints to REST conventions
* Make sure code style is consistent across all sources

## Story #1

Add ability to manage clients (companies):

* The user should be able to create, edit, delete and list Clients.
* Clients should have a company name, website URI, phone number, and physical/mailing address.
* Clients can have zero, one, or multiple associated contacts.
* When editing a person, the user should be able to choose the associated client.
* When viewing a person, the associated client should be shown.
* When viewing a client, the associated contacts should be shown.
* When editing a client, the user should be able to add or remove associated contacts.

## Story #2

Add client-side styling and validation:

* Using your preferred javascript validation technique, prevent the submission on invalid data on the edit forms and inform the user of errors. The validations implemented on the frontÂ­end should be equivalent to the existing server side validation.
* Add standard styling to the pages using a modern CSS3/HTML5 framework like Twitter Bootstrap or Foundation (or similar).
